## Artificial-Intelligence
Practicing building AI's to solve puzzles.

**A very different approach to programming.** 

Instead of us coders focusing on solving the problems,
we have to design ways to feed the right conditions to programs and let them solve the problem.

Start with identifing the PEAS!
- Performance 
- Enviorment 
- Actuators  
- Sensors 

For example, chess AI PEAS : 
- Performance : Win, speed
- Enviorment : The chess board
- Actuators : Moving the pieces
- Sensors : Seeing the board

Or self driving cars : 
- Performance : Reaches goal safely, maybe speed depending on situations, but many more. 
- Enviorment : The public roads! 
- Actuators : Steering, braking, lights, signals, wipers, etc. 
- Sensors : Camera, motion sensors, G-force sensors etc.
