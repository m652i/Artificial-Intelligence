Eight Puzzle

A sliding puzzle that  consists  of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.
The puzzle also exists in other sizes. 
If the size is 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle.

The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

•States : Integer location of tiles
•Operators : Move blank left, right, up, down
•Goal Test :  Goal state (given)
•Path Cost : One per move


HEURISTICS FOR 8-PUZZLE PROBLEM
In total, there are a possible of 9! or 362,880 possible states. 
However, using heuristic function, it is possible to reduce the number of visited states to less than 50.
Some possible heuristics for 8-Puzzle:
h1(n) = no. of misplaced tiles
may have many plateaus (indistinguishable states)
doesn’t captures the number of moves to get to the right place
h2(n) = sum of Manhattan distances (i.e., no. of squares from desired location of each tile)
doesn’t capture the importance of sequencing tiles (putting them in the right order)

(N) = number of misplaced tiles h1(s) = 7
h2(N) = sum of the (Manhattan) distances of every tile to its goal position
h2(s) = 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 18
